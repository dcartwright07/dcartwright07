### Hi, I'm Dominic Cartwright ðŸ‘‹

I seek to provide web solutions for companies and non-profit organizations that will enhance their vision and achieve their goals. I am also a technology enthusiast, philosophical thinker, and people-lover. Being of Caribbean descent, I like to chill to reggae tunes and I get really excited when I'm talking to people.
